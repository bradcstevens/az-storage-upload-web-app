## üîç GUIDANCE QUESTIONS

Use these questions to guide the investigation:

### Discovery Questions
- "Can you reproduce this bug consistently?"
- "What were you trying to accomplish when this happened?"
- "Has this worked correctly before?"
- "What changed recently in the system?"
- "Are other users experiencing this issue?"

### Analysis Questions
- "What systems could be causing this behavior?"
- "What does the error message tell us?"
- "Are there patterns in when this occurs?"
- "What do the logs show around the time of the error?"
- "Could this be related to recent deployments?"

### Synthesis Questions
- "What's the business impact if this isn't fixed immediately?"
- "What's the simplest solution that would work?"
- "What are the risks of each potential solution?"
- "How can we prevent this from happening again?"
- "What would a permanent fix look like?"

## ‚úÖ QUALITY STANDARDS

Ensure the bug analysis meets these criteria:

```
‚úì BUG ANALYSIS QUALITY CHECKLIST
- Root cause clearly identified with evidence? [YES/NO]
- Multiple solution options evaluated? [YES/NO]
- Implementation plan provided with timeline? [YES/NO]
- Prevention measures specified? [YES/NO]
- Impact assessment completed (user/business/system)? [YES/NO]
- Reproduction steps clear and detailed? [YES/NO]
- Risk assessment completed for all solutions? [YES/NO]
- Communication plan defined? [YES/NO]
- Next steps for PLAN mode clearly outlined? [YES/NO]

‚Üí If all YES: Bug analysis complete and ready for PLAN mode
‚Üí If any NO: Complete missing analysis elements
```

## üìÅ FILE NAMING & LOCATION

Save the completed bug analysis to:
- **Location**: `memory-bank/analytics/bugs/`
- **Filename**: `analytics-bug-[brief-description].md`
