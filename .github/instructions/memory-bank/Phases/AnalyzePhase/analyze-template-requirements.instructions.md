## üîç GUIDANCE QUESTIONS

Use these questions to guide the requirements analysis:

### Discovery Questions
- "Who are the primary users and what are their main goals?"
- "What problem are we trying to solve and why is it important?"
- "What does success look like for users and the business?"
- "What constraints do we need to work within?"
- "What assumptions are we making about users and the market?"

### Analysis Questions
- "What are the core features that must be included?"
- "How do users currently solve this problem?"
- "What are the technical requirements and constraints?"
- "How should we prioritize different features?"
- "What are the performance and scalability requirements?"

### Synthesis Questions
- "What's the simplest solution that would provide value?"
- "How can we break this into manageable development phases?"
- "What are the key risks and how can we mitigate them?"
- "How will we measure success?"
- "What needs to be planned in detail for implementation?"
