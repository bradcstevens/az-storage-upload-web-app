## üîç GUIDANCE QUESTIONS

Use these questions to guide the brainstorming:

### Discovery Questions
- "What's the real problem we're trying to solve?"
- "Who are we solving this for and what do they really need?"
- "What would success look like?"
- "What constraints do we need to work within?"
- "What assumptions should we challenge?"

### Analysis Questions
- "What if we approached this completely differently?"
- "How might we combine different ideas?"
- "What would the ideal solution look like without constraints?"
- "What are we not considering?"
- "How could we make this 10x better?"

### Synthesis Questions
- "Which ideas have the most potential?"
- "What patterns do we see across the best ideas?"
- "How can we build on the strongest concepts?"
- "What would it take to make this real?"
- "What's the simplest version that would work?"
