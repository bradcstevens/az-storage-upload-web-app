## Blocked Items
None - Ready to proceed with technology validation

## Implementation Phases (Planned)
1. **Phase 1**: Project Setup & Configuration (Day 1)
2. **Phase 2**: Backend API Development (Day 2-3)
3. **Phase 3**: Frontend Development (Day 3-4)
4. **Phase 4**: Testing & Validation (Day 4-5)

âœ… **Deployment Target**: Azure App Service Linux with Python runtime

## Next Milestone
**ðŸš€ IMPLEMENT MODE** - All prerequisites complete. Ready to begin Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration

## Design Foundation Complete
- **UI/UX Design**: 57KB atomic design specifications (atoms â†’ pages, design tokens, responsive strategy)
- **Architecture**: Backend proxy upload pattern documented with implementation details
- **Security**: Phased authentication strategy (MVP: IP restrictions, Future: Azure AD SSO)
- **Documentation**: ~157KB total design documentation ready for implementation
