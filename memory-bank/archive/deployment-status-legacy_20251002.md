## Deployment Options

You now have **3 options** to deploy the application:

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended) ‚ö°
**Fastest and easiest method** - fully automated

```bash
# Make script executable (already done)
chmod +x deploy-azure.sh

# Run deployment script
./deploy-azure.sh
```

**What it does**:
- ‚úÖ Creates resource group
- ‚úÖ Creates storage account with unique name
- ‚úÖ Creates blob container with public access
- ‚úÖ Configures CORS
- ‚úÖ Creates App Service Plan (B1 Basic)
- ‚úÖ Creates App Service (Python 3.11)
- ‚úÖ Configures application settings
- ‚úÖ Sets startup command
- ‚úÖ Enables HTTPS-only
- ‚úÖ Deploys application via ZIP
- ‚úÖ Verifies deployment with health check
- ‚úÖ Saves deployment info to file

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes

---

### Option 2: Manual Azure CLI Commands
**Step-by-step control** - follow the guide

Follow the commands in `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` under "Option B: Azure CLI"

**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes

---

### Option 3: Azure Portal (GUI)
**Visual interface** - point and click

Follow the instructions in `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` under "Option A: Azure Portal"

**Estimated Time**: 20-30 minutes

---

## Quick Start: Automated Deployment

### Step 1: Review Configuration

The deployment script uses these settings:
- **Resource Group**: `rg-video-upload-app`
- **Location**: `eastus`
- **Storage Account**: `stvideoupload[timestamp]` (auto-generated unique name)
- **Container**: `videos`
- **App Service Plan**: `asp-video-upload` (B1 Basic tier)
- **App Service**: `app-video-upload-[timestamp]` (auto-generated unique name)

To customize, edit `deploy-azure.sh` lines 24-29 **before** running.

### Step 2: Run Deployment

```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/bradcstevens/code/github/bradcstevens/az-storage-upload-web-app

# Run the deployment script
./deploy-azure.sh
```

The script will:
1. Display configuration and ask for confirmation
2. Create all Azure resources
3. Deploy the application
4. Verify deployment
5. Display application URL and useful commands

### Step 3: Access Your Application

After successful deployment, you'll see:

```
üåê Access your application:
  https://app-video-upload-XXXXX.azurewebsites.net
```

Open this URL in your browser and start uploading videos!

## Post-Deployment Checklist

After deployment completes:

### Immediate Tests
- [ ] Open application URL in browser
- [ ] Verify page loads with correct styling
- [ ] Check browser console for errors (should be none)
- [ ] Verify health check endpoint returns `"azure_storage": "connected"`
- [ ] Upload a small video file (< 10MB)
- [ ] Verify upload progress displays
- [ ] Confirm success notification appears
- [ ] Check video appears in uploaded videos list
- [ ] Click "View" button to verify video is accessible
- [ ] Verify video plays in browser

### Azure Portal Verification
- [ ] Navigate to Azure Portal ‚Üí Storage Account ‚Üí Containers ‚Üí videos
- [ ] Verify uploaded video appears in container
- [ ] Check blob properties (content type, size)
- [ ] Test blob URL directly in browser

### Application Logs
```bash
# View real-time application logs
az webapp log tail \
  --name app-video-upload-XXXXX \
  --resource-group rg-video-upload-app
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails

1. **Check Azure CLI authentication**:
   ```bash
   az account show
   ```

2. **View detailed error logs**:
   ```bash
   az webapp log tail --name <app-service-name> --resource-group rg-video-upload-app
   ```

3. **Verify resources were created**:
   ```bash
   az group show --name rg-video-upload-app
   az storage account list --resource-group rg-video-upload-app
   az webapp list --resource-group rg-video-upload-app
   ```

4. **Common issues**:
   - **Storage account name taken**: Script auto-generates unique names, but if it fails, edit the script
   - **App Service name taken**: Script auto-generates unique names, but if it fails, edit the script
   - **Timeout during deployment**: Application may still be starting, wait 2-3 minutes and test again
   - **CORS errors**: Check CORS configuration in storage account settings

### If Application Won't Start

1. **Check application settings**:
   ```bash
   az webapp config appsettings list \
     --name <app-service-name> \
     --resource-group rg-video-upload-app
   ```

2. **Verify startup command**:
   ```bash
   az webapp config show \
     --name <app-service-name> \
     --resource-group rg-video-upload-app \
     --query "linuxFxVersion"
   ```

3. **Review deployment logs in Azure Portal**:
   - Navigate to App Service ‚Üí Deployment Center ‚Üí Logs

---

## Deployment Information

After successful deployment, deployment details are saved in:
- `deployment-info.txt` (local file with credentials - **DO NOT COMMIT**)

This file contains:
- Resource Group name
- Storage Account name
- Application URL
- Connection string (for local testing)

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING**: This file contains sensitive credentials. It is automatically excluded from Git via `.gitignore`.

---

## Cleanup (If Needed)

To delete all Azure resources and stop incurring costs:

```bash
# Delete entire resource group (removes all resources)
az group delete --name rg-video-upload-app --yes --no-wait

# This will delete:
# - Storage Account
# - Blob Container
# - App Service
# - App Service Plan
```

**Estimated Cost Savings**: ~$15-20/month

---

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. **Share Application URL**: Share with team members or stakeholders
2. **Test Functionality**: Perform comprehensive browser testing
3. **Monitor Performance**: Set up Application Insights alerts
4. **Update Documentation**: Add production URL to README.md
5. **Plan Phase 2**: Consider enhancements (authentication, SAS tokens, etc.)
