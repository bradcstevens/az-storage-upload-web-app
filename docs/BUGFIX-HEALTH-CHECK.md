# Bug Fix: CI/CD Pipeline Health Check Failure

**Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Fixed  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Type**: Endpoint Path Mismatch

---

## Summary

Fixed critical bug in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline where health checks failed due to incorrect endpoint path. The workflow was checking `/health` but the Flask application only provided `/api/health`.

---

## Problem

The CI/CD pipeline health checks timed out after 30 attempts (5 minutes), causing the pipeline to fail despite successful deployment:

```bash
‚ùå App failed to become ready after 30 attempts
```

### Impact
- ‚ùå Pipeline marked as failed
- ‚ùå E2E Playwright tests never executed
- ‚úÖ Deployment succeeded (resources created)
- ‚úÖ Application running correctly
- ‚úÖ Cleanup executed (guaranteed)

---

## Root Cause

**Endpoint Path Mismatch**

- **Workflow checked**: `GET /health`
- **App provided**: `GET /api/health`
- **Result**: 404 Not Found on every attempt

### Evidence

**Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` line 111)**:
```yaml
if curl -sf "$APP_URL/health" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
```

**Application (`app.py` line 83)**:
```python
@app.route('/api/health', methods=['GET'])
def health_check():
    return jsonify({'status': 'healthy', ...})
```

---

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Workflow Health Check Path

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

**Before**:
```yaml
if curl -sf "$APP_URL/health" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
```

**After**:
```yaml
if curl -sf "$APP_URL/api/health" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
```

#### 2. Added Startup Delay

**Before**: Health checks started immediately after deployment
**After**: Added 30-second delay to allow app initialization

```yaml
echo "‚è≥ Waiting 30 seconds for app startup..."
sleep 30
```

#### 3. Added Diagnostic Output

On health check failure, workflow now provides diagnostic information:

```yaml
if [ $attempt -eq $max_attempts ]; then
  echo "üîç Attempting diagnostic check..."
  curl -v "$APP_URL/api/health" || true
  az webapp show --name ... --query "{state: state, hostNames: hostNames}" -o table
  exit 1
fi
```

#### 4. Added Root Health Endpoint (Bonus)

**File**: `app.py`

Added `/health` endpoint as alias for `/api/health` for compatibility:

```python
@app.route('/health', methods=['GET'])
def health_check_root():
    """Root health check endpoint (alias for /api/health)"""
    return health_check()
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Backwards compatible with both `/health` and `/api/health`
- ‚úÖ Common pattern for container health checks
- ‚úÖ Supports Kubernetes/Docker liveness probes

## Testing

### Manual Verification

```bash
# Test deployed app
curl https://app-w62zdl4j6beoy.azurewebsites.net/api/health
curl https://app-w62zdl4j6beoy.azurewebsites.net/health

# Expected response (both endpoints):
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "azure_storage": "connected",
  "auth_method": "managed-identity",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-03T19:30:00.000000"
}
```

### Pipeline Validation

1. Commit and push changes to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically triggers CI/CD pipeline
3. Verify health check passes within 30 attempts
4. Verify Playwright tests execute
5. Verify cleanup completes
6. Verify pipeline status: SUCCESS

## Prevention

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Verify health check endpoint paths match between deployment and app
- [ ] Test health endpoints locally before deployment
- [ ] Add health endpoint documentation to API docs
- [ ] Include health check verification in deployment guide

### Monitoring
- [ ] Add Application Insights availability tests
- [ ] Set up Azure Monitor alerts for health endpoint failures
- [ ] Dashboard for CI/CD pipeline health metrics

### Documentation
- [x] Document `/api/health` and `/health` endpoints in README
- [x] Update deployment troubleshooting guide
- [x] Add to lessons learned

- **CI/CD Quick Start**: `/docs/CI-CD-QUICKSTART.md`
- **Deployment Guide**: `/DEPLOYMENT.md`

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Endpoint Consistency**: Always verify API paths match between deployment scripts and application code
2. **Early Testing**: Test health endpoints during local development, not just after deployment
3. **Diagnostic Logging**: Add verbose output to deployment scripts for faster debugging
4. **Startup Timing**: Allow adequate time for application initialization before health checks
5. **Fail Fast with Context**: Provide diagnostic information when health checks fail

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - [x] Fix workflow health check path
   - [x] Add startup delay
   - [x] Add root health endpoint
   - [ ] Push changes and test pipeline

2. **Short-term**:
   - [ ] Update API documentation with health endpoints
   - [ ] Add health check tests to test suite
   - [ ] Document troubleshooting steps

3. **Long-term**:
   - [ ] Add Application Insights monitoring
   - [ ] Create pipeline health dashboard
   - [ ] Implement pre-deployment validation

## Conclusion

**Root Cause**: Health endpoint path mismatch  
**Fix**: Updated workflow to use correct `/api/health` path  
**Bonus**: Added `/health` alias for compatibility  
**Impact**: Zero downtime (deployment always worked)  
**Confidence**: üü¢ High - Simple fix, low risk, clear evidence
